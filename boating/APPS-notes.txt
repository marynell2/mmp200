The realWind (Wind NOAA) app from Flytomap does one, and only one, thing - but it does it well, and you really can't complain much about a free app. When it knows your location (by GPS or wi-fi fix), it displays a map with superimposed wind arrows that 

At iTunes it's titled "Wind NOAA" and can't be found by searching "realWind." The app itself calls itself "realWind" and doesn't reference the phrase "Wind NOAA" anywhere. 

 essentially a hook to lead users into other Flytomap products, which are mostly maps (with satellite and photos and other bells and whistles) for lakes, parks, travel locations, etc. - as well as a marine chart version. The marine mapper ("FlyToMap GPS HD") is more a tourist product than a serious chartplotter like PocketNav or Charts and Tides. But if you ignore these other products, the wind app is a nice freebie for boaters to get a quick look at wind conditions.
